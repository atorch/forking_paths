From Gelman's blog (first link in the list above):

> Statistical analysis shows how it is possible — indeed, easy — to get statistical significance in an uncontrolled study in which rules for data inclusion, data coding, and data analysis are determined after the data have been seen. Simmons, Nelson, and Simonsohn called it “researcher degrees of freedom” and Eric Loken and I called it “the garden of forking paths.” It’s sometimes called “fishing” or “p-hacking” but I don’t like those terms as they can be taken to imply that researchers are actively cheating.
